  ## Installation

  Navigate to https://github.com/robinsonfdossantos/Business-Management.

  Open a local built-in Terminal (powershell, bash) on your local machine.

  Navigate to a desired folder to place your project in, using 'cd "folder"'.

  Use 'git clone' to copy the repository to your local computer by typing "git clone git@github.com:robinsonfdossantos/Business-Management.git".
  
  ## Usage

  Run the terminal built into VS Code. Make sure you have installed all required packages using 'npm install or npm i'.
  
  Before running the program make sure you run the database by typing 'mysql -u root -p' and after entering your password type 'source schema.sql;' to create the database or load it again. You can also run 'source seed.sql;' to populate your database as an example to better understand how the application works. Make sure you have navigated to the right path in the terminal to run the database, for example './Business-Management/db'.

  Then open a new terminal and run the program using the command 'node server.js or npm start'.

  When the application loads, you will be presented with a list of options as shown in the animation below.

  In this example, I loaded my seed.sql file to populate my database and demonstrate some select queries to query existing departments and roles.
